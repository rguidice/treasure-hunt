# Treasure Hunt
Treasure hunt designed for my little brother who's in 7th grade. The hunt was made to test math skills and the ability to accurately use Google to find history/geography answers, as well as the ability to learn new things on the fly and adapt to challenges.

It features a math section and history/geography section that lead into a cipher section. The result of the ciphers must be searched for in a Linux filesystem using grep to find the coordinates of the buried treasure.
